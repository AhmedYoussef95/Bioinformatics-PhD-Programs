# Bioinformatics PhD Programs in the US

https://ahmedyoussef.shinyapps.io/bioinformatics_phd_programs/

This is a web app I have developed to display the available Bioinformatics PhD programs in the United States. I developed this app to assist me with my graduate school search. I compiled the list of PhD programs myself, as I couldn't find a good list online.

The data can be viewed in either a map format or a table format, and the user can alternate between both views by using the tabs at the top of the page. The list currently contains 36 PhD programs which I have manually compiled, and more programs will be added in case I learn of some that I missed. I plan to regularly update the app for the information to remain up-to-date.

This app was developed using the *Shiny* package in R. The *Leaflet* package was also used for rendering the map.
