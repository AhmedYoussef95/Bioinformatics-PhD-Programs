# Bioinformatics PhD Programs in the US

This is a web app I have developed to display the available Bioinformatics PhD programs in the United States. I developed this app due to the noticed lack of lists for Bioinformatics graduate programs online.

The data can be viewed in either a map format or a table format, the user can alternate between both views by using the tabs at the top of the page. The list currently contains 36 PhD programs which I have manually compiled, and more will be added if found. I plan to regularly update the app for the information to remain up-to-date.

This app was developed using the *Shiny* package in R. The *Leaflet* package was also used for rendering the map.
